# Classification-of-Power-Quality-events-using-CNN
Power Quality issues like voltage sag, swell, frequency deviations may cause a huge damage to power system equipments as well as human being. So, detecting them at a right time is really important. For now we have some devices called "Relays". A relay is basically a device which detects the fault and then shuts the power system. For now, for each power quality issue we have a different relays and their machanism is also different, hence increasing the cost. So in this project, I have tried to classify the all the power quality issues using a CNN model. And this model can be used as a relay mechanism to detect the fault. So only one relay will be required for all the Power Quality events, hence cost will also reduce.
The data for this project was taken from http://map.pqube.com/ . I have taken data with 230 V line-neutral voltage and 50 hz frequency.
A lot of preprocessing methods were used on this data and finally pictures generated from markov transition field of all the three phases were taken as input to the CNN.
An overview of this project is in major_project_final_ppt.
